* TODO install target with DESTDIR
      - name: Install
        run:
          make install DESTDIR=$PWD/inst V=1
The above workflow step failed, something related to the ERTS binaries
not being present at the expected location.
* TODO installcheck target with DESTDIR
This requires setting ERL_ROOTDIR accordingly in the autotest suite.
* TODO install target without DESTDIR
* TODO installcheck target without DESTDIR
* TODO Add release documentation
